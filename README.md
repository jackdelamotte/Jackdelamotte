## Hi, I'm Jack 👨🏻‍🏫

I'm a student at Cal Poly who's studying computer science. I'm on a mission to learn how to create better software and how that can make our digital future a better place. Also figuring out how to incorporate more emojis into my pull requests 👾.

Last year I had to privilege of developing a SaaS product for indie outdoor stores during my time at [The Parable Group](https://www.parablegroup.com/) and next year I get to start an exciting new journey at [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/)!
