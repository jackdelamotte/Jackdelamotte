## Hi, I'm Jack 👨🏻‍🏫

I'm a software engineer at [Relativity Space](https://www.relativityspace.com) where I'm writing code to test and launch rockets.

I've also had the privilege of building alongside the talented folks at [Rebellion Defense](https://www.rebelliondefense.com), [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/), and [The Parable Group](https://www.parablegroup.com/).

Check out my [site](http://jackdelamotte.com/) to learn more about me or read one of my two blog posts!
