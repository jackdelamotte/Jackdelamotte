## Hi, I'm Jack 👨🏻‍🏫

I'm a software engineer. I'm on a mission to learn how to create better, faster, and simpler software and how to have a great time doing it! Also figuring out how to incorporate more emojis into my pull requests 👾.

I've also had the privilege of developing alongside the talented folks at [The Parable Group](https://www.parablegroup.com/) and [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/) during my time as an intern.

Check out my [site](http://jackdelamotte.com/) to learn more about me or read one of my two blog posts!
